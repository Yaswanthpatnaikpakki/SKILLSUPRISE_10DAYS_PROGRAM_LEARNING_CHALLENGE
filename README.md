# SKILLSUPRISE_10DAYS_PROGRAM_LEARNING_CHALLENGE
As a part of learning cyber security and ethical hacking at skillsuprise I  have taken 10 days challenge program where I can learn skills related to  be a malware analyst.
As part of Malware challange these two days I learned how to build an  Electron app malware detection!
Explored how attackers exploit JavaScript and Node.js in Electron-based apps to inject malicious code, steal credentials, and bypass security layers.
Built a demo to simulate threats, analyze behavior, and implement countermeasures using secure coding practices and threat modeling.
üîê Cybersecurity meets real-world application‚Äîbecause protecting users starts at the code level.
